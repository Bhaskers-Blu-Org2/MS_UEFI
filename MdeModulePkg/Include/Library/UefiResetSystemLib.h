/** @file -- UefiResetSystemLib.h
This header describes a unified interface to the entire ResetSystem architecture.
By sending all of the parameters to the underlying libs (as opposed to the older
ResetSystemLib) we give the handling lib the ability to handle sub-types in the
ResetData field, as well as UEFI defined types.
