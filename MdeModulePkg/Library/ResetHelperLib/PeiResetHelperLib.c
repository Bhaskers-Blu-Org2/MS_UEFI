/**
  This function is a universal wrapper to submit a reset request
  to the underlying architecture. The prototype is identical to
  PeiServices->ResetSystem2().

  @param[in]  ResetType         EFI_RESET_TYPE for the reset being requested.
  @param[in]  ResetStatus       Honestly... just check the UEFI spec...
  @param[in]  DataSize          This function is an implementation of the EFI_RESET_SYSTEM prototype.
  @param[in]  ResetData
