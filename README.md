Define a time based event mechanism for PEI (Pei Delayed Dispatch):

* Eliminate spin loops for timing. Instead of blocking for 50 or 100 ms, the driver   would request callbacks after 50ms (or 100ms) and allow other PEIMâ€™s to dispatch. Each loop through the PEI dispatcher will attempt to dispatch each of the queued delayed dispatch requests.
  
* Method to schedule a callback after a minimum delay, not a real time callback. Maintains a 64 bit "State" for use by the callback.

* PPI has only one function - Register, to register a function to be called after the required dealy with the current value of "State".

```
Status = DelayedDispatchPpi->Register (DelayedDispatchPpi, 
                                       TestDispatchFunction, 
                                       0,                    // Initial state is 0 
                                       100000);              // 100ms 

```
* Callback can request to be called back again after a new delay.  If *NewDelay if not set to a new value, the Delayed Dispatch element is terminated.
```
