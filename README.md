## High Level Goals

Define a time based event mechanism for PEI (Pei Delayed Dispatch):

* Eliminate spin loops for timing. Instead of blocking for 50 or 100 ms, the driver   would request callbacks after 50ms (or 100ms) and allow other PEIMâ€™s to dispatch. Each loop through the PEI dispatcher will attempt to dispatch each of the queued delayed dispatch requests.
  
* Method to schedule a callback after a minimum delay, not a real time callback. Maintains a 64 bit "State" for use by the callback.

* PPI has only one function - Register, to register a function to be called after the required dealy with the current value of "State".

```c
Status = DelayedDispatchPpi->Register (DelayedDispatchPpi, 
                                       TestDispatchFunction, 
                                       0,                    // Initial state is 0 
                                       100000);              // 100ms 

```

* Callback can request to be called back again after a new delay.  If *NewDelay if not set to a new value, the Delayed Dispatch element is terminated.

```c
VOID
EFIAPI
TestDispatchFunction (
    IN OUT UINT64 *State, 
    OUT UINT32 *NewDelay) { 
  switch (*State) { 
  case 0: 
      *State = 1; 
      *NewDelay = 200000; // 200 ms 
      break; 
  case 1: 
      *State = 2; 
      *NewDelay = 300000; //300 ms 
      break; 
  case 2: 
      *State = 3; 
      *NewDelay = 400000; //400 ms 
      break; 
  case 3: 
      break; 
  default: 
      DEBUG((DEBUG_ERROR,__FUNCTION__ " Invalid function entry\n")); 
      break; 
  }
}
```
